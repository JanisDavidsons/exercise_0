solves three exercises. It consists of three parts - two functions
and one class.

    Then open terminal within a folder, were you want to download file.
Enter command "git clone" and paste adress you copied above in terminal.

    And now type php solution.php

![git demo](gif/execution.gif)


This exercise shows:
 
          * how to find first od even pair in array.
          * how to find sum of number in array from index a to index b.
          * how to extract part of string from first character occurrence to second char occurrence.
          
If I had more time, I would implement a way, to let user enter search parameters for each function.
