This example shows:
 
 Markup : * how to find first od even pair in array.
          * how to find sum of number in array from index a to index b.
          * how to extract part of string from first character occurrence to second char occurrence.
          
If I had more time, I would implement a way, to let user enter search parameters for each function.
